<h2>What is Aardvark?</h2>
Aardvark is a simple chat client for Android. All you need to do is to install it, choose an alias and start chatting! That's right, you don't even need to register!<br>

Aardvark was developed in Java as a project in the undergraduate course DAT255 at Chalmers University of Technology.
